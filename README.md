# COVID-Queries

Most of the organisations that provide information related to COVID-19 have a FAQ section in their website. But the user has to spend time searching for the answer. COVID Queries solves this problem by using an interactive chatbot.

COVID Queries website has a chatbot on the home page. The chatbot has a vast knowledge base of around 300 question-answer pairs. To make the conversations more human, the knowledge base also includes some casual question-answer pairs. Using COVID Queries chatbot, the user can get accurate information very quickly. The website also contains information related to the symptoms of COVID-19 and the best practices to prevent contacting COVID-19. The final part of the website contains information related to authentic resources for further reading. The FAQ chatbot knowledge base was built using QnA Maker and deployed as a Web App Bot. The website was built using HTML and CSS. It was deployed as a Static Web App.
